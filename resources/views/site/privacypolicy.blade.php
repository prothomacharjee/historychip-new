                <p class="ms-3"><strong>Promotional Offers from the Company.</strong> If you do not wish to have your
                    email address used by us to promote our own or third parties&rsquo; products or services, you can
                    opt-out by logging into the Website and adjusting your user preferences in your account profile or by
                    sending us an email stating your request to <a
                        href="mailto:support@historychip.com">support@historychip.com</a>. If
                    we have sent you a promotional email, you may send us a return email asking to be omitted from future
                    email distributions.</p>
                <p>If you deactivate your account or request that History Chip delete your personal information, we may
                    still retain certain information associated with your account for analytical purposes and record-keeping
                    integrity, as well as to prevent fraud, enforce our terms and conditions, take actions we deem necessary
                    to protect the integrity of the Website or our users, or take other actions otherwise permitted by
                    law.&nbsp;</p>
                <p>You have the right to request that we disclose certain information to you about our collection and use of
                    your personal information over the past 12 months. Once we receive and confirm your verifiable consumer
                    request, we will disclose to you:</p>
                <ul class="softsource-unorder-list">
                    <li>The categories of personal information we collected about you.</li>
                    <li>The categories of sources for the personal information we collected about you.</li>
                    <li>Our business or commercial purpose for collecting or selling that personal information.</li>
                    <li>The categories of third parties with whom we share that personal information.</li>
                    <li>The specific pieces of personal information we collected about you (also called a data portability
                        request).</li>
                    <li>If we sold or disclosed your personal information for a business purpose, two separate lists
                        disclosing: (1) sales, identifying the personal information categories that each category of
                        recipient purchased; and (2) disclosures for a business purpose, identifying the personal
                        information categories that each category of recipient obtained.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>You have the right to request that we delete any of your personal information that we collected from you
                    and retained, subject to certain exceptions. Once we receive and confirm your verifiable consumer
                    request, we will delete (and direct our service providers to delete) your personal information from our
                    records, unless an exception applies. We may deny your deletion request if retaining the information is
                    necessary for us or our service provider(s) to: </p>
                <ol class="softsource-order-list">
                    <li>Detect security incidents, protect against malicious, deceptive, fraudulent, or illegal activity, or
                        prosecute those responsible for such activities.</li>
                    <li>Debug products to identify and repair errors that impair existing intended functionality.</li>
                    <li>Exercise free speech, ensure the right of another consumer to exercise their free speech rights, or

                    <li>Enable solely internal uses that are reasonably aligned with consumer expectations based on your
                        relationship with us.</li>
                    <li>Comply with a legal obligation.<br></li>
                </ol>
                <br>
                <p>To exercise the access, data portability, and deletion rights described above, please submit a verifiable
                    consumer request to us by emailing us at <a
                        href="mailto:compliance@historychip.com"><u>compliance@historychip.com</u></a>.
                </p>
                <p>Only you, or someone legally authorized to act on your behalf, may make a verifiable consumer request
                    related to your personal information. You may also make a verifiable consumer request on behalf of your
                    minor child.</p>
                <p>You may only make a verifiable consumer request for access or data portability twice within a 12-month
                    period. We cannot respond to your request or provide you with personal information if we cannot verify
                    your identity or authority to make the request and confirm the personal information relates to you. The
                    verifiable consumer request must:</p>
                <ul class="softsource-unorder-list">
                    <li>Provide sufficient information that allows us to reasonably verify you are the person about whom we
                        collected personal information or an authorized representative; and</li>
                    <li>Describe your request with sufficient detail that allows us to properly understand, evaluate, and
                        respond to it.</li>
                </ul>
                <br>
                <p>Making a verifiable consumer request does not require you to create an account with us. We will only use
                    personal information provided in a verifiable consumer request to verify the requestor's identity or
                    authority to make the request.</p>
                <p>We endeavor to respond to a verifiable consumer request within forty-five (45) days of its receipt. If we
                    require more time (up to 90 days), we will inform you of the reason and extension period in writing.</p>
                <p>If you have an account with us, we will deliver our written response to that account. If you do not have
                    an account with us, we will deliver our written response by mail or electronically, at your option.</p>
                <p>Any disclosures we provide will only cover the 12-month period preceding the verifiable consumer
                    request's receipt. The response we provide will also explain the reasons we cannot comply with a
                    request, if applicable. For data portability requests, we will select a format to provide your personal
                    information that is readily useable and should allow you to transmit the information from one entity to
                    another entity without hindrance.</p>
                <p>We do not charge a fee to process or respond to your verifiable consumer request unless it is excessive,
                    repetitive, or manifestly unfounded. If we determine that the request warrants a fee, we will tell you
                    why we made that decision and provide you with a cost estimate before completing your request.</p>
                <p>In certain jurisdictions, you have the right to request access and receive information about the Personal
                    Information we maintain about you, to update and correct inaccuracies in your Personal Information, to
                    restrict or object to the processing of your Personal Information, to have the information blocked,
                    anonymized, or deleted, as appropriate, or to exercise your right to data portability to easily transfer
                    your Personal Information to another company. Those rights may be limited in some circumstances by local
                    law requirements. In addition to the above-mentioned rights, you also have the right to lodge a
                    complaint with a competent supervisory authority subject to applicable law.</p>
                <h4>13. International Cross-Border Data Transfer</h4>
                <p> History Chip is based in the United States. Personal information that we collect may be transferred to
                    and stored at partners or service providers which may be inside or outside the European Economic Area,
                    including the United States. By submitting your personal data, you agree to such transfers.</p>
