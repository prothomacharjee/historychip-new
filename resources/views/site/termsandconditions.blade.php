                    the end of these Terms of Service.
                    It is not necessary to send us a rejection of a future change to this Disputes section if you had
                    properly opted out within the first thirty (30) days after you first accepted the provisions in this
                    Disputes section.
                    If you have not properly opted out, then by rejecting a future change, you are agreeing that you will
                    arbitrate any dispute between us in accordance with the language of this Disputes section, as modified
                    by any changes you did not reject.
                    A notification sent pursuant to this paragraph solely affects these Terms of Service; if you previously
                    entered into other arbitration or dispute resolution agreements with us or enter into other such
                    agreements in the future, your notification that you are opting out of the provisions in this Disputes
                    section shall not affect the other arbitration agreements between you and us.</p>
